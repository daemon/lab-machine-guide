# Overview

This collection of documents serves a highly specific purpose: to guide those whom have been tasked with building (from scratch) and maintaining a GPU-enabled computer for deep learning.
Specifically, this guide is applicable to beginners who wish to build a personal computer, graduate students who must build and maintain lab machines for their research group, and curious supervisors who just want to know what the aforementioned students are doing.

In this guide, I'll try to help the reader spec and build their own machine, maintain that machine for themselves and fellow users, and avoid critical mistakes, some of which I've made.

## About Me

I build and maintain lab machines for [Jimmy's research group](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/students.html) at the University of Waterloo.
